# find-the-hat

This is a simple Javascript game that generates a 2D field. The player begins in the top left corner and leaves a path of asterisks '*'. The goal is to find the hat, indicated by '^', and to avoid falling into the holes indicated by '0'.

## To Do

- Create prompts so the user can generate the field size and the percentage of holes on the field.
- Make sure the game is always solvable.
- Create a # of moves count.
- Add rudimentary graphics.
